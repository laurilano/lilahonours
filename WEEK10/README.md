# WEEK 10
Main points:

- Running cases in H, R1, R2.
- Developed a case manager excel to keep track of runs and locations
- Started progress on heat flux calculations
    - Tr=1.3 is negative, and Tr=2 is positive?

- 2x cases downloaded from onedrive from H, but approx 72GB per case so will take a while to get 
- 1x case on R2
- 2x case on R1
- From 2 points, case seems to be more -ve closer to 1.0 which is unexpected
